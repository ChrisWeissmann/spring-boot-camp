# Spring Boot Camp

Working plan to get started with Spring Boot

1. Tools

   - Java 11 - JDK - You need a Java Development Kit installed. Amazon's implementation Corretto is a good choice -
     - [AWS Correto download](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/de_de/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)
   - Package manager - Homebrew - Homebrew is a package manager for Mac. We will use this to install some tools easily
     - [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
   - IDE/Code editor - VSCode/Codium - I like to use Codium, the open-source telemetric free VSCode version. It has a bunch of plugins and helps development quite a bit. Intelij IDEA is also a very good choice. I use the paid version at work and really like it.
     - [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)
     - VSCode spring Boot Plugins
       - [VSCode java-spring-boot docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-spring-boot)
       - [VSCode spring boot dev pack plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pivotal.vscode-boot-dev-pack)
       - [VSCode Java plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
   - Postman/insomnia - You will need a tool for making REST requests. I like Insomnia because it's nice and clean. But Postman also works
     - [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)
            - [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
   - MongoDB - We will use a NoSQL database that save objects. - Install mongodb as a service in homebrew locally
     - [MongoDB installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
     - Install a tool to look at the database data e.g. [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
