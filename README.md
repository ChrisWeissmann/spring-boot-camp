# Spring Boot Camp

Working plan to get started with Spring Boot

1. Tools
    1.Java 11 - JDK
        - You nee a Java Development Kit installed. Amazon's implementation Corretto is a good choice
            - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/de_de/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html
    2. Package manager - Homebrew 
        - Homebrew is a package manager for Mac. We will use this to install some tools easily
            - https://brew.sh
    3. IDE/Code editor - VSCode/Codium
        - I like to use Codium, the opensource telematic free VSCode version. It has a bunch of plugins and helps development quite a bit. Intelij IDEA is also a very good choice. I use the paid version at work and really like it.

    4. VSCode spring Boot Plugins
        - https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-spring-boot

        - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack
    5. Postman/insomnia
        - Need a tool for making REST requests. I like Insomnia because it's nice an clean. But Postman also works
            - https://insomnia.rest/download
            - https://www.postman.com/downloads/
    6. MongoDB
        - Install mongodb as a service in homebrew locally
            - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
        - Install a tool to look at the database data e.g. Compass
            - https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass?_ga=2.89662299.13204281.1645284675-778649257.1645284675
